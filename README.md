## üîß Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hadialshaer/DataScience-NewsAnalytics.git
   cd DataScience-NewsAnalytics
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install the necessary tools and datasets for working with sentiment analysis and entity recognition on Arabic text:
   ```
   pip install camel_tools
   ```
   ```
   camel_data -i sentiment-analysis-all
   ```
   ```
   camel_data -i ner-all
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the main script to start the scraping process:**

   ```
   python web_scraper_main.py
   ```
   This will start the process of parsing the sitemap, scraping articles, and saving the data into JSON files.

2. **Output:**

   The scraped data will be stored in the `data_articles/`, with each file named according to the year and month (e.g., `articles_2024_08.json`).

2. **Dashboard with visualized endpoints**

   Run the `app.py` script, and open the url that refers to your local server.

2. **Enjoy the show üòâ**
   
## Customization

- **Storage Path:** Update the directory path in `FileUtilityClass.py` to change where JSON files are stored.
- **Target Classes:** Modify `ArticleScraperClass.py` to customize which `<p>` tags or classes to scrape.
